# Pair Programming with AI

This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Pair Programming with AI. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._

## Instructions

The exercise files for this course are provided as a playground for you to experiment with using various AI tools as pair programmers. As such there is no progressive project or even specific code examples provided here. Instead there is a static web page project (the `/static` folder), a partially built React.js project (the `/react` folder), and an empty `/playground` folder where you can place your own files.

## Installing

To run the build process for the react project:

1. Open a Terminal.
2. In Terminal, Navigate to the `/react` folder.
3. Type in `npm install` and press Enter.
4. Type in `npm run dev` and press Enter.
   This starts the Vite build process and dev server.
